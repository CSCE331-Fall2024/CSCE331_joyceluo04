                    CSCE221 Data Structures: This course taught the implementation of abstract data types
                        and the runtimes of different algorithms based on their implementation. We learned many kinds of sorting algorithms and their best and worst-case performance scenarios.<br>
                    CSCE312 Computer Organization: This course was focused on computer architecture with a heavy emphasis on
                        logic gates, circuitry, and x86 processor design.<br>

                <u>Areas Of Interest</u><br>
                <div class="indentclass">UX/UI Design: I have always loved being creative and artistic since I was a child. I enjoy handling front-end aspects of programming such as designing the user
                    interface or creating webpages.
                <br>
                Game Design/Animation: Everybody loves games! I've loved playing various mobile and desktop games since my youth and would love to innovate and design my own characters and make my ideas come to life on screen.
                Consulting: I love being engaged and challenged on the job. Consulting offers a variety of avenues into different industries
                    that broaden my horizons. Finding the solution to a problem and interacting with clients directly would work amazingly with my love for
                    public speaking and intercommunication.
                <br>
                Corporate Finance: I thrive in fast-paced environments and have a very rational and logical personality. I excel in heavy quantitative work
                    and see the best results when given time to prepare, design, and deliver the highest quality presentation I can.
