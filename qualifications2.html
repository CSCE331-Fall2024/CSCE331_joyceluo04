                <b><u>Areas Of Interest</u></b><br>
                <div class="indentclass">UX Design: I have always loved being creative and artistic since I was a child. I find joy in handling front-end aspects of programming such as designing the user
                    interface or creating webpages.
                <br>
                Consulting: I love being engaged and challenged on the job. Consulting offers a variety of avenues into different industries
                    that offers insight and broadens my horizons. Finding the solution to a problem and interacting with clients directly would work amazingly with my love for
                    public speaking and intercommunication.
                <br>
                Corporate Finance: I thrive in fast-paced environments and have a very rational and logical personality. I enjoy heavy quantitative work
                    and see best results when given time to prepare, design, and deliver the highest quality presentation I can.
